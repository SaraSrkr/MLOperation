# Machine Learning Operations Project

This project goes through the main steps that take the trained model into production and allow the project stakeholder get ability to interact with it and consume endpoint to get or post data.

## short description of future improvment
This project use ACI service to deploy the model which is known by its fast and simplicity and as a future improvement we can try to use AKS service that can expand but it will take more effort

## Key Steps

## Automated ML Expermint : register bankmarketing dataset and create auto ML expermint and deploy the best model

## enable login and excute logs.py to enable application insights

## Show Swagger documentation after run swagger.sh and serve.py 
I change the port to 9000

## Concume Model Endpoint : copy rest url and its key to endpint.py file and excute it then excute benchmark.sh

## Create, Publish and Consume a Pipeline : uploud jubter notebook and update the varibales to meet my enviroment then run all cells to create and puplish pipeline
